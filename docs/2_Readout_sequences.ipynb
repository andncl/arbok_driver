    "`ReadSequence`\\\n",
    "The ReadSeqeunce is a child class of the SubSequence which we explored in Tutorial 1. Arbitrary waveforms can still be played, parameterised and swept.\n",
    "The ReadSequence is meant to handle measurement sequences and describe them in a device agnostic way. For this the classes in the rest of this list are introduced. They all relate to a single given ReadSequence.\n",

    "`Observable`\\\n",
    "Each observable handles a single result that is being accquired during the execution of a ReadSequence. Observables store the qua variables that store measurement results temporarily and the streams (to be discussed later) they are saved to. Each result is assigned to a single signal instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ReadoutPoint`\\\n",
    "A readout point describes a direct readout of a given quantum element at a different 'point' (e.g in voltage or frequency space).\n",
    "Qua commands describing this measurement are given in the `qua_measure` method.\n",
    "Per Readout point, multiple observables can be introduced whose FPGA variables are automatically declared, assigned and saved to the correct stream (discussed later) by this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "`AbstractReadout`\\\n",
    "The AbstractReadout works similarly to the ReadoutPoint but gives you all the freedom. Qua commands can be executed, arbitrary arguments like observables from other AbstractReadouts or even ReadoutPoints can be passed as arguments to process them further. in comparison to the ReadoutPoint, the results (observables) of an AbstractReadout can be assigned to ANY given signal."
