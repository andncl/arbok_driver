    "Arbok is a top-level python control framework based on [QCoDeS](https://microsoft.github.io/Qcodes/index.html) compiling into FPGA instructions ([QM-QUA SDK](https://pypi.org/project/qm-qua/1.1.7/)) for [quantum machines hardware](https://www.quantum-machines.co/). The core idea behind arbok is to write **qubit control sequences in a device and measurement setup agnostic manner** that are configured/ scaled to larger systems by providing the respective **configurations that characterize that given system**.\n",
